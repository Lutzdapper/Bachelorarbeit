# Bachelor Thesis

The stored Python files are the files that were used for the final state of the bachelor thesis. The files with the extension "*allData.py" do not create a data set with only three celebrities during the data cleansing process, but a data set with all celebrities that are included in the data set with at least 20 images.

The intermediate storage of the data in pickle files was carried out because these pickle files were ultimately read into Google Colab in order to train the neural networks with the hardware provided there.

The corresponding data can be downloaded under the following link: http://mmlab.ie.cuhk.edu.hk/projects/CelebA.html [18.12.2019].
